In this project, I wants to create a model that can predict the price of apartments in the city of Buenos Aires

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project analyzes and predict apartment price in buenos aires real estate apartments using machine learning models. This price prediction model would be build based on three key fundamental dependent variable -size, location, neighbourhood and everything else.  The goal is to determine factors and variables with great impact on apartment prices in buenos aires. This will support:

+ Valuation of real estate property

+ Investment decisions for investors
